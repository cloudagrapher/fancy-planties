# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current testing infrastructure in the plant tracker application lacks consistency, proper global configuration, and focused coverage. Tests are failing in cascading patterns when fixes are applied, and there's an overemphasis on edge cases rather than core functionality coverage. This feature will establish a robust, maintainable testing foundation with clear patterns and comprehensive coverage of critical user workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent testing configuration and setup, so that tests run reliably and don't fail due to configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN all tests SHALL use a unified global configuration
2. WHEN a test is fixed THEN other tests SHALL NOT fail due to shared state or configuration conflicts
3. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and configurations
4. IF a test requires specific setup THEN it SHALL use standardized test utilities and helpers
5. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN they SHALL have consistent behavior across environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want focused test coverage on core functionality, so that I can ensure critical user workflows work correctly without maintaining excessive edge case tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL prioritize core user workflows over edge cases
2. WHEN measuring coverage THEN critical paths SHALL have at least 80% test coverage
3. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL focus on integration and user behavior over implementation details
4. IF edge case tests exist THEN they SHALL be clearly justified and documented
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN tests SHALL remain stable and not require constant updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized test patterns and utilities, so that writing and maintaining tests is efficient and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing component tests THEN developers SHALL use standardized testing utilities
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN developers SHALL use consistent request/response patterns
3. WHEN testing database operations THEN developers SHALL use standardized database test helpers
4. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN developers SHALL use established mock patterns
5. WHEN testing authentication THEN developers SHALL use consistent auth test utilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear test organization and naming conventions, so that I can easily find, understand, and maintain tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN they SHALL follow a clear directory structure
2. WHEN naming test files THEN they SHALL use consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN writing test descriptions THEN they SHALL clearly describe the behavior being tested
4. WHEN grouping tests THEN they SHALL be organized by feature or component
5. WHEN documenting tests THEN they SHALL include clear setup and teardown instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable test isolation and cleanup, so that tests don't interfere with each other and can run in any order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN each test SHALL have isolated state and not affect other tests
2. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL clean up any created resources or state
3. WHEN tests use external dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly mocked or isolated
4. WHEN database tests run THEN they SHALL use transaction rollback or test database cleanup
5. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not conflict with each other

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage of critical user workflows, so that I can be confident the application works correctly for end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user authentication THEN all auth flows SHALL be covered (login, logout, session management)
2. WHEN testing plant management THEN core CRUD operations SHALL be thoroughly tested
3. WHEN testing care tracking THEN care logging and history SHALL be comprehensively covered
4. WHEN testing data import THEN CSV import workflows SHALL be fully tested
5. WHEN testing search functionality THEN search and filtering SHALL be properly covered

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and efficient test execution, so that I can run tests frequently during development without significant delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the full test suite THEN it SHALL complete in under 2 minutes
2. WHEN running individual test files THEN they SHALL execute quickly for rapid feedback
3. WHEN tests use external resources THEN they SHALL be optimized for speed
4. WHEN running tests in watch mode THEN only affected tests SHALL re-run
5. WHEN tests require database operations THEN they SHALL use efficient test data setup

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear test failure reporting and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues when tests fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the cause and location
2. WHEN debugging tests THEN developers SHALL have access to detailed logging and state information
3. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN failure reports SHALL provide sufficient information for remote debugging
4. WHEN assertion failures occur THEN they SHALL show expected vs actual values clearly
5. WHEN tests timeout or hang THEN they SHALL provide clear timeout information and stack traces
