## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fancy-planties
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Choose your development approach:**

   #### Option A: Local Development (Recommended)

   Run the app locally with containerized database:

   ```bash
   # Start only the database (maps port 5433 externally to 5432 internally)
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.local up -d postgres

   # Generate migration files from schema (first time only)
   npm run db:generate:local

   # Run database migrations using local environment (.env.local)
   npm run db:migrate:local

   # Seed database with plant taxonomy data (optional but recommended)
   npm run db:seed

   # Start development server locally
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Important**: Ensure your `.env.local` file has the correct DATABASE_URL:
   ```bash
   # For development with Docker on port 5433
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:simple_password_123@localhost:5433/fancy_planties
   ```

   #### Option B: Fully Containerized Development

   Run both app and database in containers:

   ```bash
   # Start entire development environment
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   
   # Or run in background
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   #### Option C: Production-like Environment

   Test with production configuration:

   ```bash
   # Requires .env file with production variables
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

5. **Available Docker Compose Files:**
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment (database on port 5433)
   - `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment with migrations
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Default production setup
   - `docker-compose.watchtower.yml` - Production with auto-updates

6. **Managing Docker Environments:**

   ```bash
   # Stop development environment
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   
   # Stop and remove volumes (clears database data)
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
   
   # View logs
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
   
   # Restart specific service
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart postgres
   ```

7. **Environment-Aware Database Configuration**

   The application now supports environment-specific database commands that automatically load the correct configuration:

   ```bash
   # Local development (uses .env.local)
   npm run db:generate:local   # Generate migrations for localhost:5433
   npm run db:migrate:local    # Apply migrations to localhost:5433
   npm run db:studio:local     # Open studio connected to localhost:5433
   npm run db:push:local       # Push schema to localhost:5433

   # Production (uses .env.prod)
   npm run db:generate:prod    # Generate migrations for postgres:5432
   npm run db:migrate:prod     # Apply migrations to postgres:5432 (Docker hostname)
   npm run db:studio:prod      # Open studio connected to postgres:5432
   npm run db:push:prod        # Push schema to postgres:5432

   # Auto-detection (fallback behavior)
   npm run db:generate         # Uses NODE_ENV or falls back to .env.prod
   npm run db:migrate          # Same auto-detection logic
   npm run db:studio           # Same auto-detection logic
   npm run db:push             # Same auto-detection logic
   ```

   **Environment Files**:
   - `.env.local` ‚Üí `localhost:5433` (for local development with Docker)
   - `.env.prod` ‚Üí `postgres:5432` (for Docker Compose environments)
   - `.env` ‚Üí Fallback configuration

8. **Open the application**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Create an account and start adding plants!

### CI/CD Skip Instructions

To save CI/CD resources when making documentation-only changes, you can skip builds by starting your commit message with specific keywords:

**Skip Keywords:**
- `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` - Standard CI skip patterns
- `[skip build]` or `[build skip]` - Explicit build skip
- `[docs]` - For documentation-only changes
- `[readme]` - For README updates

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "[readme] Update development setup instructions"
git commit -m "[docs] Fix typo in API documentation" 
git commit -m "[skip build] Minor formatting changes"
git commit -m "Add new plant feature"  # Normal build
```

The workflow will still run for pull requests to validate changes, but won't push new Docker images unnecessarily.

### Production Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive deployment instructions.

## üß™ Testing

Our comprehensive testing suite includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests with optimized parallel execution for faster development cycles. The testing approach focuses on user workflows and behavior rather than implementation details.

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests with parallel execution
npm test

# Specific test suites
npm test -- src/__tests__/api/plant-management.test.js
npm test -- src/__tests__/integration/
npm test -- src/__tests__/components/

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage with detailed reporting
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Email verification specific tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="email" --verbose

# Run tests with specific patterns
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should create plant instance"
```

### Testing Architecture

Our testing strategy follows a hierarchical approach:

- **Integration Tests (60%)**: Complete user workflows and end-to-end functionality
- **API Tests (25%)**: Endpoint validation, authentication, and data handling
- **Component Tests (15%)**: User interactions, form validation, and error handling

### Key Testing Principles

- **Client/Server Separation**: Server components are tested through integration tests and API endpoints, not direct rendering
- **User-Focused**: Tests simulate real user interactions rather than testing implementation details
- **Reliable Patterns**: Consistent test utilities and factories ensure maintainable, non-flaky tests
- **Performance Optimized**: Parallel execution and proper cleanup for fast feedback cycles
- **Mock Strategy**: Proper separation of auth functions (`validateRequest` vs `validateVerifiedRequest`)
- **Response Format Validation**: Tests verify actual API response structures and data serialization

### Test Performance Optimization

The test suite is configured for optimal performance:

- **Parallel Execution**: Uses 50% of CPU cores locally, 2 workers in CI
- **Memory Management**: 512MB worker memory limit prevents memory leaks
- **Test Isolation**: Proper cleanup between tests with resetMocks/clearMocks
- **Fast Feedback**: Bail on first failure in CI environments
- **Caching**: Jest cache enabled for faster subsequent runs

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% across branches, functions, lines, and statements
- **Coverage Reports**: Available in text, LCOV, and HTML formats
- **Coverage Location**: `./coverage/` directory with detailed HTML reports

### Testing Documentation

- **[Testing Guide](./docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md)**: Comprehensive patterns and best practices
- **[Quick Reference](./docs/TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)**: Common commands and templates
- **[Test Maintenance](./docs/TEST_MAINTENANCE.md)**: Debugging and maintenance procedures
