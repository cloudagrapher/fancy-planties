# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Plant Tracker App is a comprehensive plant management system designed to help users track their plant collections, care schedules, and propagation activities. The app will provide a mobile-native experience with bottom navigation that replaces traditional spreadsheet-based plant tracking with an intuitive, touch-optimized application. The system will feature four main sections accessible via bottom tabs: Plants (collection management), Care (scheduling and tasks), Propagation (tracking and lineage), and Profile (settings and data management). The app will support user authentication, plant taxonomy management, care scheduling, propagation tracking, and image management while maintaining data segregation between users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Data Management

**User Story:** As a plant enthusiast, I want to create a secure account and have my plant data kept separate from other users, so that I can privately manage my personal plant collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email and password THEN the system SHALL create a unique user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and create a secure session
3. WHEN a user accesses plant data THEN the system SHALL only display data belonging to that specific user
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and require re-authentication
5. IF a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent access

### Requirement 2: Plant Taxonomy and Instance Management

**User Story:** As a plant collector, I want to manage both plant species information and individual plant instances, so that I can track multiple plants of the same species with different care needs and locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a plant species THEN the system SHALL store taxonomy information including family, genus, species, and cultivar/common name as separate fields
2. WHEN a user creates a plant instance THEN the system SHALL link it to a plant species and allow custom nickname and location
3. WHEN a user views their plant collection in the Plants tab THEN the system SHALL display all active plant instances in a mobile-optimized grid layout
4. WHEN a user searches for plants THEN the system SHALL filter results by any taxonomy field (family, genus, species, cultivar), nickname, location, or care status
5. WHEN a user marks a plant as inactive THEN the system SHALL hide it from the main view but retain historical data
6. WHEN a user enters plant taxonomy THEN the system SHALL provide separate input fields for family, genus, species, and cultivar/common name for precise botanical classification

### Requirement 3: Care Schedule and History Tracking

**User Story:** As a plant caretaker, I want to track fertilizing and repotting schedules for each plant, so that I can maintain proper care routines and see historical care patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs fertilizer application THEN the system SHALL record the date and update the next due date based on the plant's schedule
2. WHEN a user views a plant's care history THEN the system SHALL display a timeline of all fertilizer applications and repotting events
3. WHEN a fertilizer application is due THEN the system SHALL indicate this visually in the plant grid and detail views
4. WHEN a user logs a repotting event THEN the system SHALL record the date and allow notes about pot size or soil changes
5. WHEN a user sets a fertilizer schedule THEN the system SHALL calculate and display future due dates
6. WHEN a user accesses the Care tab THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with overdue tasks, upcoming care items, and quick action buttons
7. WHEN a user views the care dashboard THEN the system SHALL group tasks by urgency (overdue, due today, due this week) with visual indicators

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Propagation Management

**User Story:** As a plant propagator, I want to track propagation attempts from both my existing plants and external sources (gifts, trades, purchases), so that I can monitor success rates and maintain flexible plant lineage records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a propagation from an existing plant THEN the system SHALL create a propagation record linked to the parent plant instance
2. WHEN a user starts a propagation from an external source THEN the system SHALL create a propagation record with external source information (gift, trade, purchase, etc.) and no parent plant link
3. WHEN a user updates propagation status THEN the system SHALL track progress through stages (rooting, planted, established)
4. WHEN a propagation is successful THEN the system SHALL allow conversion to a full plant instance
5. WHEN a user views a plant instance THEN the system SHALL display any propagations created from that plant
6. WHEN a user views propagation history THEN the system SHALL show success rates and timing statistics for both internal and external propagations
7. WHEN a user accesses the Propagation tab THEN the system SHALL display active propagations organized by status with progress indicators
8. WHEN a user edits an existing propagation THEN the system SHALL allow changing the parent plant relationship or external source information
9. WHEN a user creates a propagation THEN the system SHALL provide options to select from existing plants OR specify external source details
10. WHEN a user views propagation details THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether the propagation came from an owned plant or external source

### Requirement 5: Image Management

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want to attach and view photos of my plants, so that I can track growth progress and identify plants easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads plant images THEN the system SHALL store them securely and associate them with the correct plant instance
2. WHEN a user views a plant THEN the system SHALL display all associated images in a gallery format
3. WHEN a user adds multiple images THEN the system SHALL allow setting a primary image for grid display
4. WHEN a user deletes an image THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently and update the display
5. IF image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 6: Data Import and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing spreadsheet user, I want to import my current plant data from CSV files, so that I can transition to the app without losing my historical records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports plant taxonomy CSV THEN the system SHALL create plant species records with proper validation
2. WHEN a user imports fertilizer schedule CSV THEN the system SHALL create plant instances with care history
3. WHEN a user imports propagation CSV THEN the system SHALL create propagation records linked to appropriate parent plants
4. IF import data has conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide options to resolve duplicates or errors
5. WHEN import is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of imported records

### Requirement 7: Mobile-Native Navigation and Interface

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to have intuitive bottom navigation like native mobile apps, so that I can quickly access different sections while managing my plants in the garden or greenhouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app THEN the system SHALL display a bottom navigation bar with primary sections: Plants, Care, Propagation, and Profile
2. WHEN a user taps a bottom navigation item THEN the system SHALL switch to that section with smooth transitions and maintain scroll position
3. WHEN a user is in the Plants section THEN the system SHALL show the plant collection grid with search and filter options
4. WHEN a user is in the Care section THEN the system SHALL display upcoming care tasks, overdue items, and care history
5. WHEN a user is in the Propagation section THEN the system SHALL show active propagations with status tracking
6. WHEN a user is in the Profile section THEN the system SHALL provide access to settings, data import, and account management
7. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL highlight the active tab and maintain navigation state
8. WHEN a user performs actions within a section THEN the system SHALL use modal overlays or slide-in panels to maintain navigation context

### Requirement 8: Progressive Web App Capabilities

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work like a native mobile application with offline support, so that I can manage my plants even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs the PWA THEN the system SHALL function like a native app with app icon and splash screen
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL allow viewing cached plant data and queue updates for sync
