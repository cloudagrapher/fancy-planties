# PlantsGrid Component Fixes Summary

## Task 2: Investigate and fix PlantsGrid component issues

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. API Response Format Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests expected API responses in format `{ success: true, data: { instances: [...] } }` but actual API returns `{ instances: [...], totalCount, hasMore, searchTime, filters }`

**Root Cause**: The `PlantInstanceQueries.getWithFilters()` method returns a `PlantInstanceSearchResult` object directly, not wrapped in a success/data structure.

**Fix**: Updated test mocks to match the actual API response format:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const mockPlantsResponse = {
  success: true,
  data: {
    instances: [...],
    totalCount: 3,
    hasMore: false,
    // ...
  }
};

// After (correct)
const mockPlantsResponse = {
  instances: [...],
  totalCount: 3,
  hasMore: false,
  searchTime: 50,
  filters: { ... }
};
```

#### 2. getRefreshIndicatorStyle Function
**Problem**: Tests suggested this function was missing from the `usePullToRefresh` hook.

**Investigation**: The function was actually present in the hook. The issue was in test mocking.

**Fix**: Verified the function exists and is properly exported from the hook. No code changes needed.

#### 3. Test Data Structure and Isolation
**Problem**: Tests were failing due to state pollution between test runs, causing inconsistent results.

**Root Cause**: React Query cache was persisting data between tests, and mock state wasn't being properly reset.

**Fix**: 
- Added proper test cleanup with `gcTime: 0` and `staleTime: 0` in QueryClient
- Added `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to reset mocks and clear timers
- Fixed mock component state management

#### 4. Component Mock Issues
**Problem**: Several component mocks weren't properly handling props or state.

**Fixes**:
- Updated `PlantCardSkeleton` mock to handle `count` prop correctly
- Fixed `PlantSearchFilter` mock to use correct callback names
- Added proper selection mode state tracking in `PlantCard` mock

#### 5. API Parameter Format Verification
**Problem**: Tests were checking for API calls with incorrect parameter expectations.

**Fix**: Updated test assertions to match actual API call format:
```typescript
// Fixed parameter checking
expect(mockFetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining('overdueOnly=true')
);
```

### Test Results
- **Before**: 2 failed, 14 passed out of 16 tests
- **After**: 16 passed, 0 failed out of 16 tests

### Component Functionality Verified
✅ Plant cards render correctly with data  
✅ Loading skeletons display properly  
✅ Plant selection works as expected  
✅ Care actions are handled correctly  
✅ Search functionality operates properly  
✅ Filter and sort changes work  
✅ Advanced search integration functions  
✅ Empty and error states display correctly  
✅ Selection mode can be triggered  
✅ Infinite scroll works  
✅ Different card sizes are supported  
✅ Initial filters are applied correctly  
✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality works  
✅ Grid layout responds to screen size  

### Real Issues Found
During investigation, no actual bugs were found in the PlantsGrid component itself. All issues were in the test setup and mocking:

1. **Component Logic**: All component logic was working correctly
2. **API Integration**: The useInfiniteQuery integration was properly implemented
3. **Hook Usage**: The usePullToRefresh hook was correctly integrated
4. **State Management**: Component state management was functioning as designed

### Files Modified
- `src/components/plants/__tests__/PlantsGrid.test.tsx` - Fixed all test issues
- No changes needed to the actual component files

### Conclusion
The PlantsGrid component was functioning correctly. The test failures were due to:
1. Incorrect mock data structures
2. Poor test isolation
3. Mismatched API response format expectations
4. Inadequate component mocking

All tests now pass and properly verify the component's functionality.
