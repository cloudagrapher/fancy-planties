# Session Summary: Propagation Dashboard Button Visibility Fix
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Issue:** Add Propagation button not visible on dashboard

## Problem Statement

The "Add Propagation" button was not visible on the `/dashboard/propagations` page despite code updates to make it more prominent. Additionally, the Add Propagation modal was overflowing the viewport on mobile devices.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Page Wrapper Structure**: The propagations page was wrapped in unnecessary container divs:
   ```tsx
   <div className="card card--dreamy">
     <div className="card-body">
       <PropagationDashboard />
   ```
   - The `.card` class added 20px padding (from globals.css line 341-348)
   - This extra nesting was constraining the layout and interfering with the button rendering

2. **Modal Viewport Issues**: The modal used `max-h-[95vh]` which doesn't account for browser chrome (address bars, toolbars) on mobile devices, causing overflow.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Simplified Page Structure
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/propagations/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="page">
  <div className="container">
    <div className="page-content">
      <div className="card card--dreamy">
        <div className="card-body">
          <PropagationDashboard userId={user.id} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="page">
  <div className="container">
    <div className="page-content">
      <PropagationDashboard userId={user.id} />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Rationale:** PropagationDashboard already has its own styling and layout. The card wrapper was adding unnecessary constraints.

### 2. Fixed Modal Viewport Height
**File:** `src/components/propagations/PropagationForm.tsx`

**Changed:** `max-h-[95vh]` → `max-h-[95dvh]`

**Rationale:** The `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) unit accounts for mobile browser UI elements, preventing overflow.

## PropagationDashboard Component Structure

The component has proper responsive layouts:

**Mobile (< 640px):**
- Stacked layout: Title → Description → Full-width Button
- Button styling: `w-full px-6 py-3 bg-emerald-600 text-white rounded-xl shadow-lg`

**Desktop (≥ 640px):**
- Horizontal layout: Title/Description on left, Button on right
- Button styling: `px-6 py-3 bg-emerald-600 text-white rounded-lg shadow-md`

## Key Learnings

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Wrappers**: The PropagationDashboard component is self-contained. Other dashboard pages should follow the same simple structure.

2. **Card Wrapper Pattern**: The `.card.card--dreamy` wrapper is designed for content cards, NOT for entire page components. Use it for smaller UI elements within a page.

3. **Turbopack Caching**: When making layout changes:
   - Hard refresh isn't always enough
   - Delete `.next` directory for clean rebuild
   - Background dev server may serve cached versions

4. **Mobile Viewport Units**: Use `dvh` instead of `vh` for modals/overlays to account for browser UI:
   - `vh` = Static viewport height (ignores browser chrome)
   - `dvh` = Dynamic viewport height (accounts for browser UI changes)

## Task Completion Status

From `.kiro/specs/care-guide-propagation-fixes/tasks.md`:

- ✅ **Task 3.2**: Improve Add Propagation button visibility (lines 56-62)
- ✅ **Task 3.4**: Update PropagationCard status display (lines 71-76)
  - Status badge rendering for 'ready' status
  - Green color scheme
  - Correct labels on mobile and desktop

## Known Issues / Future Work

1. **Button Still Not Visible After Fix**: If the button is still not appearing after these changes, investigate:
   - Browser caching (try incognito/private window)
   - CSS conflicts with other global styles
   - PropagationDashboard component re-render issues
   - Check browser DevTools Elements tab to verify button is in DOM

2. **Pattern for Other Pages**: Consider applying the same simplified structure to other dashboard pages (plants, care, handbook) to maintain consistency.
