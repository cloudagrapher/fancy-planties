# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Plant Tracker App currently suffers from inconsistent design implementation, poor mobile responsiveness, and scattered local stylesheets throughout the codebase. This design system overhaul will establish a cohesive, mobile-first design system with global stylesheets, consistent component styling, and proper responsive behavior. The project will consolidate all styling into a centralized system, eliminate local CSS-in-JS and component-specific styles where unnecessary, and ensure the app renders beautifully on all device sizes with a focus on mobile-native experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Design System with Mint Green & Salmon Palette

**User Story:** As a user and developer, I want a complete design system with a trendy mint green and salmon color palette that provides consistent styling, mobile-first responsive design, and centralized CSS architecture, so that the app feels cohesive, modern, and appealing to younger millennial women.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design system is implemented THEN the system SHALL establish a primary color palette featuring mint green and salmon as the main brand colors with complementary pastels and neutrals
2. WHEN design tokens are defined THEN the system SHALL create centralized CSS custom properties for colors, spacing scales, typography scales, and border radius values with semantic naming
3. WHEN global styles are created THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive styling for forms, buttons, cards, layouts, and interactive elements using the new color palette
4. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL prioritize global utility classes over local component styles and remove at least 80% of redundant local stylesheets
5. WHEN the app is viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL display all content with proper responsive breakpoints, touch-friendly sizing (minimum 44px targets), and thumb-accessible navigation
6. WHEN forms are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply consistent styling with proper autocomplete attributes for password managers, validation feedback, and mobile-optimized inputs
7. WHEN the design system is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and guidelines for using global vs local styles

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization and CSS Architecture Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want clean, maintainable CSS architecture that loads quickly and performs well, so that the app is fast, predictable to work with, and provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS architecture is refactored THEN the system SHALL organize styles into logical modules (base, components, utilities, themes) and eliminate style duplication
2. WHEN local stylesheets are reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify and remove redundant component-specific styles that can be replaced with global patterns
3. WHEN CSS is optimized THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle size, eliminate unused styles, and use efficient selectors to improve performance
4. WHEN styles are processed THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts and ensure consistent rendering across all device sizes
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide measurable improvements in CSS bundle size and render performance
6. WHEN developers work with the system THEN the system SHALL offer clear naming conventions, organization patterns, and style guidelines

### Requirement 3: Accessibility and Mobile-Native User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs using various devices, I want the app to meet modern accessibility standards with excellent mobile usability, so that I can effectively use the app regardless of my abilities or device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN colors are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) with the mint green and salmon palette
2. WHEN interactive elements are styled THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators, hover states, and touch-friendly interactions optimized for mobile use
3. WHEN forms are designed THEN the system SHALL include proper label associations, error announcements, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML elements
4. WHEN the app is tested THEN the system SHALL pass automated accessibility testing tools and provide appropriate semantic markup and ARIA labels
5. WHEN users navigate on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are easily accessible with thumb navigation and proper spacing
6. WHEN the app renders THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy, readability, and usability across all screen sizes and orientations
