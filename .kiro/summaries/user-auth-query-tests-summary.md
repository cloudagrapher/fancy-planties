# User and Authentication Query Tests Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive user and authentication database query tests covering all critical functionality including user CRUD operations, session management, password hashing, and authentication flows.

## Test Coverage Implemented

### 1. User CRUD Operations (8 tests)
- ✅ User creation with proper validation
- ✅ User retrieval by ID and email
- ✅ User updates with timestamp tracking
- ✅ Email existence checking
- ✅ User deletion operations
- ✅ Null handling for non-existent users

### 2. Password Hashing and Verification (4 tests)
- ✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Password verification for correct passwords
- ✅ Rejection of incorrect passwords
- ✅ Empty password handling

### 3. Session Management (9 tests)
- ✅ Session creation and retrieval
- ✅ Session expiration updates
- ✅ Session deletion (individual and bulk)
- ✅ Expired session cleanup
- ✅ Session validation logic
- ✅ User session management

### 4. Authentication Flow Functions (8 tests)
- ✅ User creation through auth functions
- ✅ User retrieval through auth functions
- ✅ Complete signup workflow
- ✅ Duplicate signup prevention
- ✅ Sign-in with valid credentials
- ✅ Invalid email/password rejection

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases (5 tests)
- ✅ Database connection error handling
- ✅ Invalid session operations
- ✅ Invalid user operations
- ✅ Input validation testing
- ✅ Concurrent user creation handling

### 6. Session Cleanup and Maintenance (2 tests)
- ✅ Expired session cleanup efficiency
- ✅ No-op cleanup handling

## Key Fixes Implemented

### Database Isolation Issues
- Fixed duplicate key constraint violations by implementing unique test data generation
- Added proper test counter and timestamp-based unique identifiers
- Improved database cleanup between tests

### Delete Operation Return Values
- Fixed Drizzle ORM delete operation return value handling
- Implemented count-before-delete pattern for accurate deletion counts
- Added proper boolean return values for single deletions

### Test Data Management
- Created `getUniqueTestData()` helper for generating unique test data
- Implemented proper test isolation with unique emails and session IDs
- Added proper cleanup tracking in database test manager

### Error Handling
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- Added proper null checks and validation
- Fixed concurrent operation testing

## Test Architecture

### Test Structure
```
src/__tests__/database/user-auth-queries.test.ts
├── User CRUD Operations
├── Password Hashing and Verification  
├── Session Management
├── Authentication Flow Functions
├── Error Handling and Edge Cases
└── Session Cleanup and Maintenance
```

### Test Utilities Used
- `createDatabaseTestManager()` - Database isolation and cleanup
- `createTestUser()` - Test user factory
- `getUniqueTestData()` - Unique test data generation
- `resetUserCounter()` - Test counter reset

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 3.3 (Database Test Helpers)
- ✅ Standardized database test helpers with proper cleanup
- ✅ Consistent database query testing patterns
- ✅ Proper test isolation and state management

### Requirement 5.1 (Test Isolation)
- ✅ Each test has isolated state and doesn't affect others
- ✅ Proper cleanup of created resources
- ✅ No test interference or cascading failures

### Requirement 5.2 (Database Test Cleanup)
- ✅ Transaction-like cleanup with proper resource tracking
- ✅ Foreign key constraint handling in cleanup order
- ✅ Graceful error handling during cleanup

## Performance Metrics
- **Total Tests**: 36 tests
- **Execution Time**: ~7.5 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 100% (36/36 passing)
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all auth/user database operations

## Files Modified
1. `src/__tests__/database/user-auth-queries.test.ts` - Main test file
2. `src/lib/db/queries/users.ts` - Fixed delete operation return values
3. `src/lib/db/queries/sessions.ts` - Fixed delete operation return values and logic

## Next Steps
The user authentication query tests are now fully functional and provide comprehensive coverage of:
- User creation, retrieval, and management
- Session lifecycle management
- Password security operations
- Authentication flow validation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Database cleanup and maintenance

These tests serve as a solid foundation for ensuring the reliability and security of the authentication system.
