- Documented form simplification rationale

**PropagationDashboard.tsx:**
- Added status configuration comments explaining:
  - Status enum change from 'established' to 'ready'
  - Previous vs. current status values
  - Rationale for terminology change

**CareGuideDetail.tsx:**

## Files Modified

1. `docs/API.md` - Comprehensive API documentation updates
2. `src/components/handbook/CareGuideForm.tsx` - S3 and watering comments
3. `src/components/propagations/PropagationDashboard.tsx` - Status enum comments
4. `src/components/handbook/CareGuideDetail.tsx` - Complex logic documentation
5. `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Schema change documentation

## Documentation Improvements

### API Documentation
- Clear status enum documentation with descriptions
- Complete request/response examples
- Field-level documentation for all parameters
