# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The plant tracker application has extensive test coverage but is experiencing systematic test failures across multiple categories. The failures fall into several distinct patterns: database connection issues in integration tests, component rendering problems due to missing dependencies, mock configuration issues, and test environment setup problems. This feature will systematically address all test failures to ensure a robust, reliable test suite that supports continuous development and deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database integration tests to run reliably without requiring a live PostgreSQL connection, so that I can run tests in any environment including CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running database integration tests THEN the system SHALL use an in-memory or mock database instead of requiring a live PostgreSQL connection
2. WHEN database tests execute THEN they SHALL complete within the 10-second timeout limit
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN tests SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the mock setup issue rather than network connectivity problems
4. WHEN tests clean up database state THEN they SHALL not cause "clearImmediate is not defined" errors in the Jest environment

### Requirement 2: Component Test Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests to render and interact correctly with all dependencies properly mocked, so that I can verify component behavior without external service dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PlantsGrid component tests run THEN they SHALL properly render plant cards with mocked data
2. WHEN components use pull-to-refresh functionality THEN the getRefreshIndicatorStyle function SHALL be properly defined and mocked
3. WHEN tests expect specific DOM elements THEN those elements SHALL be present in the rendered output
4. WHEN components make API calls THEN the fetch mock SHALL return appropriate test data
5. WHEN tests verify API call parameters THEN the assertions SHALL match the actual API call format

### Requirement 3: Mock Configuration Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all browser APIs and external dependencies to be consistently mocked across all test files, so that tests run reliably in the Jest environment without browser-specific errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests use navigator APIs THEN they SHALL be properly mocked with configurable properties
2. WHEN tests interact with service workers THEN the service worker registration SHALL be mocked appropriately
3. WHEN tests use performance APIs THEN they SHALL have consistent mock implementations
4. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN mock state SHALL not leak between test suites
5. WHEN tests complete THEN all mocks SHALL be properly reset for the next test

### Requirement 4: Test Environment Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each test to run in isolation without state pollution from other tests, so that test results are deterministic and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in sequence THEN each test SHALL start with a clean state
2. WHEN global objects are modified in tests THEN they SHALL be restored after each test
3. WHEN localStorage or sessionStorage is used THEN it SHALL be cleared between tests
4. WHEN DOM elements are created THEN they SHALL be cleaned up after each test
5. WHEN async operations are pending THEN they SHALL not interfere with subsequent tests

### Requirement 5: API Route Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API route tests to properly simulate Next.js request/response handling, so that I can verify API functionality without running a full server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API route tests execute THEN they SHALL use proper Next.js Request/Response mocks
2. WHEN testing authentication endpoints THEN they SHALL properly mock session validation
3. WHEN testing database operations THEN they SHALL use mocked database queries
4. WHEN API routes return errors THEN tests SHALL verify proper error handling and status codes
5. WHEN API routes process request bodies THEN tests SHALL verify proper data validation

### Requirement 6: Performance and Accessibility Test Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and accessibility tests to run consistently with proper browser API mocks, so that I can maintain quality standards without flaky test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests measure metrics THEN they SHALL use mocked performance APIs with predictable values
2. WHEN accessibility tests check compliance THEN they SHALL have proper DOM and ARIA mocks
3. WHEN CSS performance tests run THEN they SHALL have mocked getComputedStyle with design system values
4. WHEN mobile usability tests execute THEN they SHALL have proper touch and gesture API mocks
5. WHEN visual regression tests run THEN they SHALL have consistent rendering environments

### Requirement 7: Test Execution Speed and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire test suite to complete quickly and reliably, so that I can get fast feedback during development and CI/CD processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the full test suite THEN it SHALL complete in under 60 seconds
2. WHEN tests encounter timeouts THEN they SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
3. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the root cause
4. WHEN running tests in CI THEN they SHALL have the same success rate as local development
5. WHEN tests use async operations THEN they SHALL properly handle promises and avoid race conditions

### Requirement 8: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent, realistic test data across all test suites, so that tests accurately reflect real-world usage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need plant data THEN they SHALL use consistent mock plant instances with realistic properties
2. WHEN tests need user data THEN they SHALL use properly structured user objects with authentication context
3. WHEN tests need API responses THEN they SHALL return data matching the actual API schema
4. WHEN tests create relationships between entities THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity in mock data
5. WHEN tests modify data THEN changes SHALL not persist between test runs
