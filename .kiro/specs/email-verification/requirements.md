# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements email verification for user accounts to enhance security and ensure valid email addresses. Users will receive a 6-digit verification code via email during signup and must verify their email before accessing protected features of the plant tracker application. The system will use a third-party email service (such as Resend, SendGrid, or similar) with a free tier to ensure reliable email delivery and avoid spam issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to verify my email address during signup, so that I can confirm my identity and secure my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the signup form THEN the system SHALL create an unverified user account and send a 6-digit verification code via a third-party email service
2. WHEN a verification code is generated THEN the system SHALL set an expiration time of 10 minutes
3. WHEN a user receives the verification email THEN it SHALL contain a clear 6-digit code and instructions for verification
4. WHEN the email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
4. WHEN a user enters the correct verification code within the time limit THEN the system SHALL mark their email as verified and grant access to the application
5. WHEN a user enters an incorrect verification code THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to resend my verification code if I don't receive it, so that I can complete the verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to resend a verification code THEN the system SHALL invalidate any existing codes for that email
2. WHEN a new verification code is sent THEN the system SHALL implement a 60-second cooldown before allowing another resend
3. WHEN the cooldown period is active THEN the resend button SHALL be disabled with a countdown timer
4. WHEN a user has requested more than 5 verification codes in 1 hour THEN the system SHALL temporarily block further requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want verification codes to be secure and time-limited, so that the verification process cannot be abused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification code is generated THEN it SHALL be a cryptographically secure 6-digit number
2. WHEN a verification code expires THEN it SHALL be automatically removed from the database
3. WHEN a user makes more than 5 verification attempts for a single code THEN the code SHALL be invalidated
4. WHEN a verification code is successfully used THEN it SHALL be immediately deleted from the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with an unverified email, I want to be prevented from accessing protected features, so that the system maintains security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unverified user tries to access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the email verification page
2. WHEN an unverified user tries to access API endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden status with verification required message
3. WHEN a user successfully verifies their email THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected to the dashboard
4. WHEN a user logs in with an unverified email THEN they SHALL be redirected to the verification page instead of the dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and intuitive verification interface, so that I can easily complete the email verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the verification page THEN they SHALL see a clear input field for the 6-digit code
2. WHEN a user is entering the verification code THEN the input SHALL automatically format and validate the digits
3. WHEN a verification attempt fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message (expired, invalid, or too many attempts)
4. WHEN the verification is successful THEN the user SHALL see a success message before being redirected
5. WHEN a user needs to resend the code THEN they SHALL see a prominent resend button with clear status indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain clean data and prevent resource exhaustion, so that the verification system remains performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification codes are older than 24 hours THEN they SHALL be automatically deleted via a cleanup job
2. WHEN a user account is deleted THEN all associated verification codes SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL clean up any expired verification codes
4. WHEN verification attempts exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL log the attempts for security monitoring

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a reliable third-party email service, so that emails are delivered consistently without being marked as spam.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to send verification emails THEN it SHALL use a third-party email service with a free tier (such as Resend, SendGrid, or Mailgun)
2. WHEN configuring the email service THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API keys and configuration
3. WHEN the email service API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly message
5. WHEN the email service quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and notify administrators
