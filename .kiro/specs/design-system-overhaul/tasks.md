  - Apply new button classes throughout existing components
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Implement Card and Layout Component System
  - Create standardized card component classes (card, card-dreamy, plant-card, etc.)
  - Build responsive grid systems and container utilities for consistent layouts
  - Implement page layout patterns with proper mobile-first responsive design
  - Refactor existing page components to use new layout and card systems
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.6_

- [ ] 5. Create Mobile-First Navigation and Modal System
  - Implement bottom navigation styling with active states and touch optimization
  - Create modal system with mobile-optimized slide-up animations and backdrop blur
  - Add safe area utilities for iOS devices and proper touch target sizing
  - Apply new navigation and modal styles to existing components
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.6, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Optimize CSS Architecture and Remove Redundant Styles
  - Audit existing components for redundant local stylesheets that can be replaced with global patterns
  - Remove at least 80% of unnecessary component-specific styles
  - Organize CSS into logical modules (base, components, utilities, themes)
  - Optimize CSS bundle size and eliminate style duplication
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement Accessibility and Performance Optimizations
  - Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio)

  - Add comprehensive testing for accessibility compliance and mobile usability
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6_

- [ ] 8. Create Comprehensive Design System Testing Suite
  - Write visual regression tests for all form components, buttons, and cards across different screen sizes
  - Implement automated accessibility testing to verify WCAG AA compliance and proper focus management
  - Create performance tests to monitor CSS bundle size and ensure it stays under optimization targets
  - Add mobile-specific tests for touch targets, responsive breakpoints, and password manager compatibility
  - Write component integration tests to verify design token consistency and proper styling inheritance
  - _Requirements: 1.7, 2.4, 2.5, 3.4, 3.6_
