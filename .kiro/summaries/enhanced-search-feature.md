# Enhanced Search Feature Summary

## Overview

The enhanced search system provides advanced filtering and search capabilities for plant instances, allowing users to find plants using complex criteria beyond basic text search.

## Implementation Details

### Database Layer

**File**: `src/lib/db/queries/plant-instances.ts`

Added `enhancedSearch` static method to `PlantInstanceQueries` class with the following capabilities:

- **Text Search**: Multi-field search across nickname, location, notes, and plant taxonomy
- **Image Filtering**: Filter by presence of images or specific image count ranges
- **Care Filtering**: Filter by fertilizer frequency, overdue status, and due dates
- **Date Filtering**: Support for date presets and custom date ranges
- **Advanced Sorting**: Multiple sort options including care urgency prioritization
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- **Optional Enhancements**: Statistics and facets for enhanced user experience

### API Layer

**File**: `src/app/api/plant-instances/enhanced-search/route.ts`

Enhanced search API endpoint with:

- **Parameter Parsing**: Comprehensive URL parameter parsing and validation
- **Date Preset Processing**: Automatic date range calculation for presets
- **Fallback Logic**: Falls back to regular filtering when advanced features aren't used
- **Error Handling**: Proper Zod validation and error responses

### Frontend Integration

**File**: `src/components/plants/PlantsGrid.tsx`

Updated PlantsGrid component with:

- **Enhanced Filters**: Integration with `EnhancedPlantInstanceFilter` schema
- **Filter Indicators**: Visual display of active filters with clear options
- **Search Results**: Support for both regular and enhanced search results
- **Performance**: Optimized infinite scrolling and query management

### Type System

**File**: `src/lib/validation/plant-schemas.ts`

Enhanced validation schemas:

- `enhancedPlantInstanceFilterSchema`: Comprehensive filter validation
- Support for complex filter objects (image count, fertilizer frequency)
- Date preset enumeration and validation

## Key Features

### Search Capabilities

1. **Multi-Field Text Search**
   - Search across plant nicknames, locations, notes, and taxonomy
   - Configurable search fields for targeted searches
   - Case-insensitive fuzzy matching

2. **Image-Based Filtering**
   - Filter plants with or without images
   - Filter by specific image count ranges
   - Useful for finding plants needing photos

3. **Care-Based Filtering**
   - Filter by fertilizer frequency (days, weeks, months)
   - Show only overdue plants
   - Filter by plants due within specific timeframes

4. **Date Range Filtering**
   - Preset date ranges (today, this week, this month, etc.)
   - Custom date range filtering
   - Filter by creation date or last care date

5. **Advanced Sorting**
   - Sort by care urgency (overdue first)
   - Sort by plant name, location, or dates
   - Configurable sort order (ascending/descending)

### Performance Features

1. **Efficient Queries**
   - Optimized SQL with proper joins and indexing
   - Count queries for pagination
   - Conditional query building based on active filters

2. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Statistics (total plants, overdue count, etc.)
   - Facets (available locations, plant types)
   - Performance timing for monitoring

3. **Pagination Support**
   - Configurable page sizes
   - Offset-based pagination
   - "Has more" indicators for infinite scroll

## API Usage

### Basic Enhanced Search

```http
GET /api/plant-instances/enhanced-search?searchQuery=monstera&hasImages=true&sortBy=care_urgency
```

### Advanced Filtering

```http
GET /api/plant-instances/enhanced-search?overdueOnly=true&fertilizerFrequency={"unit":"weeks","min":1,"max":2}&includeStats=true
```

### Date Preset Filtering

```http
GET /api/plant-instances/enhanced-search?datePreset=this_month&sortBy=created_at&sortOrder=desc
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "instances": [...],
  "totalCount": 25,
  "hasMore": true,
  "searchTime": 45,
  "filters": {...},
  "stats": {
    "totalActivePlants": 25,
    "overdueCount": 3,
    "dueTodayCount": 2,
    "dueSoonCount": 5
  },
  "facets": {
    "locations": [
      {"value": "Living room", "count": 8}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Filter Indicators

The PlantsGrid component now displays active filters with clear options:

- Visual chips showing active search terms
- Individual clear buttons for each filter
- "Clear all" option for bulk filter removal

### Search Performance

- Automatic fallback to regular search when advanced features aren't needed
- Debounced search input to prevent excessive API calls
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Search History**: Save and recall previous searches
2. **Saved Filters**: Create and manage filter presets
3. **Search Analytics**: Track popular search terms and filters
4. **Advanced Facets**: More detailed faceting options
5. **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search integration

## Testing

The enhanced search system includes:

- Unit tests for database query logic
- API endpoint testing with various parameter combinations
- Frontend integration tests for filter interactions
- Performance testing for large datasets

## Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with enhanced search feature description
- Updated API.md with comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Added CHANGELOG.md entry with detailed feature description
- Created this summary document for technical reference

## Migration Notes

This is a new feature with no breaking changes. Existing search functionality remains unchanged, with enhanced search available as an additional endpoint.

The feature is backward compatible and gracefully falls back to regular search when advanced features aren't used.
